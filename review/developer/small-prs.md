# Small PRs



## Why Write Small PRs? {#why}

Small, simple PRs are:

-   **Reviewed more quickly.** It's easier for a reviewer to find five minutes
    several times to review small PRs than to set aside a 30 minute block to
    review one large PR.
-   **Reviewed more thoroughly.** With large changes, reviewers and authors tend
    to get frustrated by large volumes of detailed commentary shifting back and
    forthâ€”sometimes to the point where important points get missed or dropped.
-   **Less likely to introduce bugs.** Since you're making fewer changes, it's
    easier for you and your reviewer to reason effectively about the impact of
    the PR and see if a bug has been introduced.
-   **Less wasted work if they are rejected.** If you write a huge PR and then
    your reviewer says that the overall direction is wrong, you've wasted a lot
    of work.
-   **Easier to merge.** Working on a large PR takes a long time, so you will
    have lots of conflicts when you merge, and you will have to merge
    frequently.
-   **Easier to design well.** It's a lot easier to polish the design and code
    health of a small change than it is to refine all the details of a large
    change.
-   **Less blocking on reviews.** Sending self-contained portions of your
    overall change allows you to continue coding while you wait for your current
    PR in review.
-   **Simpler to roll back.** A large PR will more likely touch files that get
    updated between the initial PR submission and a rollback PR, complicating
    the rollback (the intermediate PRs will probably need to be rolled back
    too).

Note that **reviewers have discretion to reject your change outright for the
sole reason of it being too large.** Usually they will thank you for your
contribution but request that you somehow make it into a series of smaller
changes. It can be a lot of work to split up a change after you've already
written it, or require lots of time arguing about why the reviewer should accept
your large change. It's easier to just write small PRs in the first place.

## What is Small? {#what_is_small}

In general, the right size for a PR is **one self-contained change**. This means
that:

-   The PR makes a minimal change that addresses **just one thing**. This is
    usually just one part of a feature, rather than a whole feature at once. In
    general it's better to err on the side of writing PRs that are too small vs.
    PRs that are too large. Work with your reviewer to find out what an
    acceptable size is.
-   Everything the reviewer needs to understand about the PR (except future
    development) is in the PR, the PR's description, the existing codebase, or a
    PR they've already reviewed.
-   The system will continue to work well for its users and for the developers
    after the PR is checked in.
-   The PR is not so small that its implications are difficult to understand. If
    you add a new API, you should include a usage of the API in the same PR so
    that reviewers can better understand how the API will be used. This also
    prevents checking in unused APIs.

There are no hard and fast rules about how large is "too large." 100 lines is
usually a reasonable size for a PR, and 1000 lines is usually too large, but
it's up to the judgment of your reviewer. The number of files that a change is
spread across also affects its "size." A 200-line change in one file might be
okay, but spread across 50 files it would usually be too large.

Keep in mind that although you have been intimately involved with your code from
the moment you started to write it, the reviewer often has no context. What
seems like an acceptably-sized PR to you might be overwhelming to your reviewer.
When in doubt, write PRs that are smaller than you think you need to write.
Reviewers rarely complain about getting PRs that are too small.

## When are Large PRs Okay? {#large_okay}

There are a few situations in which large changes aren't as bad:

-   You can usually count deletion of an entire file as being just one line of
    change, because it doesn't take the reviewer very long to review.
-   Sometimes a large PR has been generated by an automatic refactoring tool
    that you trust completely, and the reviewer's job is just to sanity check
    and say that they really do want the change. These PRs can be larger,
    although some of the caveats from above (such as merging and testing) still
    apply.

### Splitting by Files {#splitting-files}

Another way to split up a PR is by groupings of files that will require
different reviewers but are otherwise self-contained changes.

For example: you send off one PR for modifications to a protocol buffer and
another PR for changes to the code that uses that proto. You have to submit the
proto PR before the code PR, but they can both be reviewed simultaneously. If
you do this, you might want to inform both sets of reviewers about the other PR
that you wrote, so that they have context for your changes.

Another example: you send one PR for a code change and another for the
configuration or experiment that uses that code; this is easier to roll back
too, if necessary, as configuration/experiment files are sometimes pushed to
production faster than code changes.

## Separate Out Refactorings {#refactoring}

It's usually best to do refactorings in a separate PR from feature changes or
bug fixes. For example, moving and renaming a class should be in a different PR
from fixing a bug in that class. It is much easier for reviewers to understand
the changes introduced by each PR when they are separate.

Small cleanups such as fixing a local variable name can be included inside of a
feature change or bug fix PR, though. It's up to the judgment of developers and
reviewers to decide when a refactoring is so large that it will make the review
more difficult if included in your current PR.

## Keep related test code in the same PR {#test_code}

Avoid splitting test code into a separate PR. Tests validating your code
modifications should go into the same PR, even if it increases the code line
count.

However, <i>independent</i> test modifications can go into separate PRs first,
similar to the [refactorings guidelines](#refactoring). That includes:

*   validating pre-existing, submitted code with new tests.
*   refactoring the test code (e.g. introduce helper functions).
*   introducing larger test framework code (e.g. an integration test).

## Don't Break the Build {#break}

If you have several PRs that depend on each other, you need to find a way to
make sure the whole system keeps working after each PR is submitted. Otherwise
you might break the build for all your fellow developers for a few minutes
between your PR submissions (or even longer if something goes wrong unexpectedly
with your later PR submissions).

## Can't Make it Small Enough {#cant}

Sometimes you will encounter situations where it seems like your PR *has* to be
large. This is very rarely true. Authors who practice writing small PRs can
almost always find a way to decompose functionality into a series of small
changes.

Before writing a large PR, consider whether preceding it with a refactoring-only
PR could pave the way for a cleaner implementation. Talk to your teammates and
see if anybody has thoughts on how to implement the functionality in small PRs
instead.

If all of these options fail (which should be extremely rare) then get consent
from your reviewers in advance to review a large PR, so they are warned about
what is coming. In this situation, expect to be going through the review process
for a long time, be vigilant about not introducing bugs, and be extra diligent
about writing tests.
