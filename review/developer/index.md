# The CL author's guide to getting through code review

The pages in this section contain best practices for developers going through
code review. These guidelines should help you get through reviews faster and
with higher-quality results. You don't have to read them all, but they are
intended to apply to every Google developer, and many people have found it
helpful to read the whole set.

-   [Writing Good CL Descriptions](cl-descriptions.md)
-   [Small CLs](small-cls.md)
-   WANT_LGTM to clarify the expectation when a CL is sent to multiple
    reviewers. You can use `WANT_LGTM=any` (the default behavior) or
    `WANT_LGTM=all` to clarify.
-   [How to Handle Reviewer Comments](handling-comments.md)

See also [How to Do a Code Review](../reviewer/), which gives detailed guidance
for code reviewers.
