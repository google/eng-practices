# Submitting PRs

Before submitting a PR, please check that your PR follows the guides below:
-   [Writing Good PR Descriptions](pr-descriptions.md)
-   [Before Submmiting PRs](before-submitting-prs.md)

Submitting a PR is simple.
-    You will mark a PR ready for review. [How to change the stage of a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)
-    A PR will auto-assign a reviewer
-    You can ask subject matter expert to review the PR by adding them to reviewers. [How to request a pull request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review)

All conversation around the PR should be kept in the Github PR, this way we can keep conversation and data around the PR in one place. (feel free to ping people in the PR comments).

If no one has claimed your code review in a reasonable amount of time, post the PR in a slack project channel and ping your team to review.

If you are requested to perform a code review
- It is your responsibility to complete the code review in a timely manner, or
- If you are not able to perform the code review, communicate to the PR's author and it is your responsiblity (reviewer's responsiblity) to find someone to take it in a timely manner.

More detail please refer to [The Code Reviewer's Guide](../reviewer/index.md)
