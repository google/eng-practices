# Submitting PRs

Before submitting a PR, please check that your PR follows the guides below:
-   [Writing Good PR Descriptions](pr-descriptions.md)
-   [Before Submitting PRs](before-submitting-prs.md)

## Submission Process

Submitting a PR is simple. 
- You will mark a PR ready for review. [How to change the stage of a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)
- A team member will automatically be assigned to review your PR.
- You will also ask subject matter expert to review the PR by adding them to reviewers. [How to request a pull request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review)

All conversation around the PR should be kept in the Github PR, this way we can keep conversation and data around the PR
in one place. (feel free to ping people in the PR comments).

**All PRs require the approval of both the assigned reviewer, *and* the selected subject matter expert to be merged.**
There are exceptions for [emergencies](../emergencies.md).

Once reviewers leave feedback on your PR and you address their concerns you should request their review again using
GitHub. This ensures they receive a notification of your updates.

## Timeliness

You should expect that your PR is reviewed by [the morning after](../reviewer/speed.md) it is submitted. If your PR
isn't being reviewed in a timely manner you can remind the reviewer or ask the team for help getting your PR reviewed
and merged.

If you are requested to perform a code review
- It is your responsibility to complete the code review in a timely manner, or
- If you are not able to perform the code review, communicate to the PR's author and find someone to agree to do the
  review in your place to ensure it gets done in a timely manner.
