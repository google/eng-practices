# Submitting PRs

Submitting a PR is simple. In slack post your PR in the Code Reviews Channel,
ping the channel with @here.
Once a developer accepts they will unpin your post.
All conversation around the PR should be kept in the Github PR, this way we can keep
conversation and data around the PR in one place(feel free to ping people in
the slack comments of your PR post).

If no one has claimed your code review in a reasonable amount of time it's time to play
slack roulette.
Simply use the alias `pull_request` in the comments of your PR post in slack. This will
ping a random developer(play the game again if the developer is out).
If you are pinged to perform a code review it is now your responsibility to either
complete the code review or if you are not able to perform the code review it is your
responsiblity to find someone to take it in a timely manner.
