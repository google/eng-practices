# The Standard of Code Review



The primary purpose of code review is to make sure that the overall
code health of PicCollage's code
base is improving over time. All of the tools and processes of code review are
designed to this end.

In order to accomplish this, a series of trade-offs have to be balanced.

First, developers must be able to _make progress_ on their tasks. If you never
submit an improvement to the codebase, then the codebase never improves. Also,
if a reviewer makes it very difficult for _any_ change to go in, then developers
are disincentivized to make improvements in the future.

On the other hand, it is the duty of the reviewer to make sure that each CL is
of such a quality that the overall code health of their codebase is not
decreasing as time goes on. This can be tricky, because often, codebases degrade
through small decreases in code health over time, especially when a team is
under significant time constraints and they feel that they have to take
shortcuts in order to accomplish their goals.

Also, a reviewer has ownership and responsibility over the code they are
reviewing. They want to ensure that the codebase stays consistent, maintainable,
and all of the other things mentioned in
["What to look for in a code review."](looking-for.md)

Thus, we get the following rule as the standard we expect in code reviews:

**In general, reviewers should favor approving a CL once it is in a state where
it definitely improves the overall
code health of the system
being worked on, even if the CL isn't perfect.**

That is _the_ senior principle among all of the code review guidelines.

There are limitations to this, of course. For example, if a CL adds a feature
that the reviewer doesn't want in their system, then the reviewer can certainly
deny approval even if the code is well-designed.

A key point here is that there is no such thing as "perfect" code&mdash;there is
only _better_ code. Reviewers should not require the author to polish every tiny
piece of a CL before granting approval. Rather, the reviewer should balance out
the need to make forward progress compared to the importance of the changes they
are suggesting. Instead of seeking perfection, what a reviewer should seek is
_continuous improvement_. A CL that, as a whole, improves the maintainability,
readability, and understandability of the system shouldn't be delayed for days
or weeks because it isn't "perfect."

Reviewers should _always_ feel free to leave comments expressing that something
could be better, but if it's not very important, prefix it with something like
"Nit: " to let the author know that it's just a point of polish that they could
choose to ignore.

Note: Nothing in this document justifies checking in CLs that definitely
_worsen_ the overall code health of the system. The only time you would do that
would be in an [emergency](../emergencies.md).

## Mentoring

Code review can have an important function of teaching developers something new
about a language, a framework, or general software design principles. It's
always fine to leave comments that help a developer learn something new. Sharing
knowledge is part of improving the code health of a system over time. Just keep
in mind that if your comment is purely educational, but not critical to meeting
the standards described in this document, prefix it with "Nit: " or otherwise
indicate that it's not mandatory for the author to resolve it in this CL.

## Principles {#principles}

*   Technical facts and data overrule opinions and personal preferences.

*   On matters of style, the [style guide](http://PicCollage.github.io/styleguide/)
    is the absolute authority. Any purely style point (whitespace, etc.) that is
    not in the style guide is a matter of personal preference. The style should
    be consistent with what is there. If there is no previous style, accept the
    author's.

*   **Aspects of software design are almost never a pure style issue or just a
    personal preference.** They are based on underlying principles and should be
    weighed on those principles, not simply by personal opinion. Sometimes there
    are a few valid options. If the author can demonstrate (either through data
    or based on solid engineering principles) that several approaches are
    equally valid, then the reviewer should accept the preference of the author.
    Otherwise the choice is dictated by standard principles of software design.

*   If no other rule applies, then the reviewer may ask the author to be
    consistent with what is in the current codebase, as long as that doesn't
    worsen the overall code health of the system.

## Resolving Conflicts {#conflicts}

In any conflict on a code review, the first step should always be for the
developer and reviewer to try to come to consensus, based on the contents of
this document and the other documents in [The CL Author's Guide](../developer/)
and this [Reviewer Guide](index.md).

When coming to consensus becomes especially difficult, it can help to have a
face-to-face meeting or a VC between the reviewer and the author, instead of
just trying to resolve the conflict through code review comments. (If you do
this, though, make sure to record the results of the discussion in a comment on
the CL, for future readers.)

If that doesn't resolve the situation, the most common way to resolve it would
be to escalate. Often the
escalation path is to a broader team discussion, having a TL weigh in, asking
for a decision from a maintainer of the code, or asking an Eng Manager to help
out. **Don't let a CL sit around because the author and the reviewer can't come
to an agreement.**
