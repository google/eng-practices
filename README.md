# Syntax Code Review Process Docs

These documents represent Syntax's collective experience of various
best practices that we have developed over time.

Currently this contains the following documents:

*   [Syntax's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two
    separate sets of documents:
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)

## Terminology

*   **PR**: Stands for "pull request," which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me." It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a PR.
